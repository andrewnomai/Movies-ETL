# Movies-ETL

## Overview 

We are tasked to predict popular movies from datasets of a hackathon. To do this, we are to extract raw data from the datasets, transform the data into a clean dataset, and then load that data into a SQL table. 

## Results
The movies table resulted in 6,052 rows of data, while the ratings table resulted in 26,024,289 rows of data.
